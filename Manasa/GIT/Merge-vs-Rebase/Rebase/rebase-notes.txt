Rebase Demo flow:
-->created new repo--clone the repo 
-->created 2 files in main branch -file-1,file-2.
-->commit-->push to main branch.
-->Add new feature branch i.e,develop
-->create one file-file-3 and then commit it and push it to develop branch.
-->now again create one file in main branch -file-4.
-->commit it and push it to main branch. Now main branch commit flow is file-1-->file-2-->file-3
-->but the develop branch flow is file-1-->file2-->file4.
-->Now rebase the develop branch with main branch (git rebase main -this command needs to run in your develop branch )
-->now check the flow in develop branch file1-file2-file4-file3(rebase changes the commit order but merge keeps the commit flow file1-file2-file3-file4)
-->now if we want to try to push the code in develop branch it throws error,
then we need to run command git push --force-with-lease origin develop.
-->once it is done raise PR and merge it to main branch and observe the commit flow of rebase.
